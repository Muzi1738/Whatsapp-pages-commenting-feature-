# Whatsapp-pages-commenting-feature-
This project replicates WhatsApp's Updates page with added features for posting updates, anonymous comments, reactions, and conversation threads. Users can post updates that automatically expire after 24 hours, and interact with others' updates through reactions and comments.

# Key Features

1. Post Updates

Users can post updates that are visible to all followers.

Each update expires 24 hours after posting, mimicking WhatsApp's status functionality.


2. Engagement and Interaction

Update Info Page: Each update has a dedicated information page where users can:

React: Like or react to updates with different emojis, similar to WhatsApp reactions.

Anonymous Commenting: Users can comment on updates anonymously. Comments are visible to all and foster public conversation.

Reply Threads: Users can reply to individual comments, allowing for conversation threads.

Comment Reactions: Each comment can receive reactions, with visible reaction counts next to each one.
